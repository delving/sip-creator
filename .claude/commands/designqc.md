description: Screenshot-based design review of the running app via openwolf designqc
argument-hint: [--url <url>] [--routes <routes>]

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Evaluate and improve the design/UI of this app:

1. Run `openwolf designqc` via Bash to capture screenshots (pass through any arguments given above).
   - The command auto-detects a running dev server, or starts one from package.json if needed.
   - Use `--url <url>` only if auto-detection fails.
   - Compressed JPEG screenshots land in `.wolf/designqc-captures/`; full pages are captured as sectioned viewport-height images (top, section2, ..., bottom).
2. Read the captured screenshots from `.wolf/designqc-captures/` with the Read tool.
3. Evaluate against modern standards (Shadcn UI, Tailwind, clean React patterns):
   - Spacing and whitespace consistency
   - Typography hierarchy and readability
   - Color contrast and accessibility (WCAG)
   - Visual hierarchy and focal points
   - Component consistency
   - Whether the design looks generic ("white-coded", no personality)
4. Provide specific, actionable feedback with fix suggestions.
5. If the user approves, implement the fixes directly in their code.
6. Re-run `openwolf designqc` to verify the improvement.

Token awareness: each screenshot costs about 2,500 tokens. For large apps, use `--routes / /specific-page` to limit captures.
